Periodictable was written by Paul Kienzle and is now developed and
maintained by the `DANSE <http://danse.us>`_ project.

We are grateful for the existence of many fine open source packages such
as `Pyparsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_, 
`NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ and `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ 
without which this package would be much more difficult to write.
